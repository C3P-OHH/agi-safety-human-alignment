# AGI Safety & Human Alignment

A public, company‑agnostic project by **Rob Parken** focused on ensuring advanced AI systems evolve in alignment with human values—love, dignity, responsibility, and spiritual wholeness—so they serve the common good.

## What this project is
- A values‑driven **framework** for alignment‑by‑design and responsible deployment.
- A set of **operational practices** for integrating human oversight, transparency, and non‑manipulative personalization.
- An **open invitation** to collaborators in research, policy, product, and faith communities.

## Why it matters
Frontier systems are increasing in capability and autonomy faster than safety practices mature. This project translates ethical intent into **practical guardrails** and **operational rituals** organizations can adopt today.
